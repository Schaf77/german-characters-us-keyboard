# Introduction:
I'm German, but use a keyboard with an American layout. So I wrote this script inorder to still be able to use special characters, that you need in German (such aus ä, ö, ü, €, ß, ...).
## Instalation:
1. First of all you will need the AutoHotkey-interpreter. You can download it here [AutoHotkey Homepage](https://www.autohotkey.com "AutoHotkey homapage")
2. Go through the setup procedure
3. After the setup is done just execute the file from this repository and the script is now running in the background
